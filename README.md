# TIC TAC TOE <br>

## Was created as an assignment for The Odin Project. <br><br>

It was created to practice the module design pattern and factory functions.<br>
I also did the bonus assignment which is creating an unbeatable AI.<br>
That was my introduction to minimax algorithm which is used in AI fields and game theory.
